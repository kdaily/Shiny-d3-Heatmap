# Shiny-d3-Heatmap
Interactive Heatmap with hover over ability and zoom by selection capability.  Run heatmapCalc first, then heatmap.  This will display the interactive heatmap.  Be sure to have your own metadata and data.  Data should initially be a csv file with header and row names. Metadata should match the length of either the rows or columns (depends on whether row or column is your samples).  

Huge thanks to Joe Cheng's d3-heatmap example.  This is an extension of his work
